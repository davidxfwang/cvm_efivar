# cvm_efivar
efivar to access Cavium ThunderX specific uefi variables

This is a utility derived from github efivar. Added read / write and parsing cavium specific uefi variables to the utility command line, by adding new options. The standard options are still wroking the way it is, even access cavium specific variables.
